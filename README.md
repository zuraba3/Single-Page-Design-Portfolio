## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and app functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

1.Change background color of body.
2.Add images and text.
3.Style all the elements.
4.Create hover effects for buttons.
5.Create slider.
6.Add media queries for responsivnes.
7.Add Javascript code to make slider functional.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a lot of practise of using Media Queries and create responsive websites. Also it was realy good to practise using more CSS properties like Grids. With this and other tools I gained a lot of experience and I wrote the CSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. The main challenge was to use javascript to give website functionality. I wrote javascript code that gives slider functionality for any display size.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
